# Timesheet-for-IQs
### Final project at GA

IQs is a company that works with multiple consultants that are payed at various rates.
The issue is that they are currently using Excel spreadsheet for tracking the worked hours. I'm planning to implement an application to track the hours that consultants put in.

The structure is the following:
* #### Administrator role:
  - should be able to logIn with administrator's account
  - should be able to create/update/delete accounts for a consultant
  - should be able to create/update/delete accounts for a manager
  - should be able to assign a manager to a consultant
  - should be able to view a report on the number of hours all consultants put in
  - print a report
  - view historical data, and reports
* #### Manager role:
  - should be able to logIn with manager's account
  - should be able to view the timesheets of all assigned to him consultants
  - should be able to
  - should be able to view/approve/deny the hours
* #### Consultant role:
  - should be able to logIn with consultant's account
  - should be able to fill out the hours worked based on his own pay-rate with the pending status
  - should be able to send a report of his timesheet to his manager for approval.
